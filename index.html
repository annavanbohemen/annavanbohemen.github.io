                <h1>Me and my history of coding</h1>
      
                <p>I started thinking I wanted to be a primary school teacher. I love to work with kids, 
                   but that was not it. Because I needed to do something I rolled into my first secretary job.
                   I was good at it so I evolved into a personal Assistant at Shell. (I sound like a pokemon)
                </p>
                <p>
                   After a few years I missed a challenge in my daily job. I was always interested in coding.
                   I did some basic HTML/ CSS, worked on the companny Sharepoint (build a few sites) and my husband is a developer.
                   So I took the bull by the horns and looked for a school to help me learn.
                   Thanks to <a href="https://www.codaisseur.com/">Codaisseur Academy</a> I learned 
                   to code in only 10 weeks. </br>
                   In those ten weeks I learned a lot! Front-end and Back-end - Javascript, HTML5, CSS, React, Redux, Node, Typescript etc etc.
                   Now I want to take my new developed skills and use them in the real world.
                </p>

                <h1>What now?</h1>
      
                <p> Now I'm looking for a job.
                    A companny that can help me develop, learn more about coding. A companny that has a great product and has mutiple opportunities!
                    But I don't only want to get from a companny, I also want to give. My skills, my time and dedication.
                    I think what I learned from previous job I can use as to make great products for costumers, because I know what they need and look for.
                </p>
      
                <h1>Currently</h1>
      
                <p> currently i'm looking for that job. But also looking for nice projects to keep on coding.
                    Because If you don't keep up you will loose the race! Making this website is step 1.
                    First some simpe HTML/ CSS. after that maybe a add a web app.. I'm not sure what it will need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site will be underconstruction constantly in de weeks to come. So check-it out.
                </p>

                <h1>Yet to come</h1>
